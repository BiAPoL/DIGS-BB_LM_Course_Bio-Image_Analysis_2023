# DIGS-BB Light Microscopy Course: Bio-image Analysis

## Introduction to Bio-image Analysis


## Google Colab

In this course we will execute image analysis workflows on [Google Colab]https://colab.research.google.com/(). Make sure you have a Google account before clicking on one of the following links.

**Note:** While using Google colab is covenient for teaching, it is not recommended to use it in daily research practice. The reason is that we must upload our research data to the internat in order to use Google colab. To avoid this, install [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) and [Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/) on your local computer or workstation as explained in [this blog post](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html) and run notebooks for your science there.
